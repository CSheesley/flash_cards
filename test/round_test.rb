# A Round is initialized with a Deck.
# The idea is that when we start a Round, the current card is the first in the deck (the first in the Deckâ€™s array of Cards).
# When we make a guess, the guess is recorded, and the next card in the deck becomes the current card.

## The take_turn method is the crux of this problem.
# The take_turn method takes a string representing the guess.
# It should create a new Turn object with the appropriate guess and Card.
# It should store this new Turn, as well as return it from the take_turn method.
# Also, when the take_turn method is called, the Round should move on to the next card in the deck.
